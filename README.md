# principal-components-analysis

## Author: Philip Amwata

### Project Description

Machine Learning (Unsupervised Learning - Clustering).
Dimensionality Reduction method - Principal Component Analysis.
From a data set containing 64 pairs of values, program
computes the covariance matrix and identifies 2 Principal Components.
The program also computes the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors associated
with the Principal Components as well as the Total variance,
showcasing the proportion as a percentage that the 2 Principal Components explain.

### Project Structure

**bin**: The output executables, both for the app and for any tests.

**build**: This folder contains all object files, and is removed on a clean.

**include**: All project header files. All necessary third-party header files that do not exist under /usr/local/include.

**src**: The applicationâ€™s source files.

**test**: All test code files.

---

### Makefile Instructions

**make**: compile and link

**make run**: run program

**make clean**: delete all object files

---

### NOTES

**Results for the Principal Component Analysis will be output to the console but a text file can also be found in the bin/ directory**
